Project from The Odin Project.

This project was a fun challenge. I found creating these methods enjoyable, and it was fascinating how I would start some methods with no idea of where to start and slowly do the work of figuring it out. 

I have refactored most of the methods from their original messy birth. Some have been refactored multiple times. I know many still could be cleaned up more.

TOP Description:

Youâ€™ll build a balanced BST in this assignment. Do not use duplicate values because they make it more complicated and result in trees that are much harder to balance. Therefore, be sure to always remove duplicate values or check for an existing value before inserting.
